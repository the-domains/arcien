This isn't for you.

Right now we've gotten rid of a few people, lets cut to it. Copywriting, SEO, PPC, segmentation blah blah blah. 

A lot of companies will trick you into thinking it's all way over your head and there's no way you could understand it (and even do it on your own). 

Well sure it's hard work and there's A LOT of creativity involved. But don't give up!

You've got this far reading this post... so you're making a good start. 

My aim is to give you all the details you need to arm yourself, team, colleague, business parter etc so marketing is no longer a mystical and magical realm.

You know what it means.

You know how it's done. 

And more importantly you know what you need....
