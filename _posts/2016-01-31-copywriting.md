# Content marketing

## Keeping it simple

You may think this is starting off with the basics. You'd be wrong. 

In fact, this is where most companies go wrong. They babble. They use floral language with acronyms, big words and indsutry phrases so they look smart and their customers think "oof they must know what they're tlaking about."

The truth is - your copy shouldn't be complicated. 

Youe copy should read like a 6th grade reading level. Any higher and you're:

a) going to cut yourself off from part of your audience, purely becuase they don't understand you  
b) going to reduce the value in what you'\\ve written becqause the meaning with be lost  
c) going to sound like a dick.

You may think this is easy.

But actually a huge part of your editing should be in simplifying what you're saying. Dont think of it as dumbing down. You're adding clariy so your customers can more quickly udnerstand what you do, and are more likely to buy. 

Let's look at an example:

Add lg IMAGE. 

Sorry LG, but what?! The first time I read the H1 my brain voice autmaticaly read it in Yoda's voice (not sure that's what they intended). 

Image aside (we'll cover them another time). 

First off - What are they selling? What's the beneift to me? Do I care?

Sure if I read the post properly I'll work out its a fridge-freezer, washing machine and HOM-BOT SQUARE (a hoover?). AND If I concentrate I can determine it's going to look after my thing an save me energy. But by now they've lost me. 

Don't make your audience work for it.
